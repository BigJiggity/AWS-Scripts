S3 Bucket Scanner and CSV Writer
Introduction
This code is a Python script that scans all the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket and writes the relevant information to CSV files. It utilizes the Boto3 library to interact with the Amazon S3 service and perform the necessary operations.

Key Concepts
Before diving into the code, let's understand a few key concepts:

Amazon S3: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a scalable object storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

Boto3: Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. It provides a Python interface to interact with various AWS services, including Amazon S3.

CSV: CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. It is a file format used to store tabular data, where each line represents a row and the values are separated by commas.

Code Structure
The code is structured into several sections, each serving a specific purpose:

Logging Configuration: The code starts by configuring the logging settings. It sets the format of the log messages, the logging level (INFO in this case), and the handlers to write the logs to a file and the console.

Date Configuration: The code sets two dates, checkdate_1 and checkdate_2, to define the range of object last modified dates to consider. Only objects with last modified dates between these two dates will be processed.

Data Directory Creation: The code checks if a directory named "Data" exists. If not, it creates the directory to store the CSV files.

Main Function: The process_bucket function is the main function that processes a single bucket. It takes a bucket object as input and performs the following steps:

Checks if there is a state file to determine the starting point of processing.
Retrieves the last known bucket and object from the state file (if it exists).
Determines the starting point for processing based on the last known bucket and object.
Creates a directory for storing the CSV files related to the current bucket.
Iterates through the objects in the bucket and checks if their last modified dates fall within the specified range.
Stores the relevant information of the objects (bucket name, object key, size, last modified date, and storage class) in a list.
Writes the list of objects to a CSV file when the object count reaches 1000 or the iteration is complete.
Updates the state file with the current bucket and object.
Writes the remaining objects to a CSV file if any.
State File Functions: The code includes three functions related to the state file:

check_state_file: Checks if the state file exists.
read_state_file: Reads the last known bucket and object from the state file.
update_state_file: Updates the state file with the current bucket and object.
Main Execution: The code creates an S3 resource using Boto3 and retrieves all the buckets. It then utilizes multithreading with a ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize the scanning and writing of CSV files for each bucket.

Script Completion: The code logs a completion message and the execution time.

Code Examples
Here are a few code examples to illustrate the usage of the functions:

Creating an S3 resource:
language-python
 Copy code
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
Retrieving all the buckets:
language-python
 Copy code
buckets = s3.buckets.all()
Processing a single bucket:
language-python
 Copy code
bucket = s3.Bucket('my-bucket')
process_bucket(bucket)
Conclusion
This Python script provides a convenient way to scan all the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket and store the relevant information in CSV files. It utilizes the Boto3 library for interacting with the Amazon S3 service and supports multithreading to improve performance. By understanding the code structure and key concepts, you can easily customize and extend the functionality to suit your specific requirements.

To use this code, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the S3 buckets and install the required dependencies (Boto3). You can also refer to the provided readme.md file for additional instructions and information.
